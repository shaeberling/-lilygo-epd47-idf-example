# lilygo-epd47-idf-example
An example ESP32 IDF app for the LilyGo EPD 4.7"  (T5 E-Paper 4.7 Inch)

These are converted from https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-EPD47, which has Arduino implementations, to be pure ESP-IDF projects.

The main library source has been turned into an IDF component and lives over at https://github.com/shaeberling/lilygo-epd47-idf.

Important: Make sure to enable PSRAM!
